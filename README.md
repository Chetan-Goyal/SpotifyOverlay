# SpotifyOverlay
This is a very simple Spotify overlay written in Python 3.
It is currently only compatible with Windows but I will change that in the future.
I know that there is many bugs but a lot of them end up fixing themselves after some time.   

***This is currently unusable because I am currently working on handling requests server-sided and need to implement that.  
This will make it a lot easier***   
  
    
*Instructions for Compiling*
1. This is only if you are trying to modify this. If you just want a pre-compiled version go to the releases tab.
2. Use literally any compiler, for this example I am going to be using pyinstaller.
3. `git clone https://github.com/Ixyk-Wolf/SpotifyOverlay/`
4. `cd SpotifyOverlay`
6. `pyinstaller --onefile .\Spotify Overlay.py`
7. Feel free to modify and recompile!
