# SpotifyOverlay
This is a very simple Spotify overlay written in Python 3.
It is currently only compatible with Windows but I will change that in the future.
I know that there is many bugs but a lot of them end up fixing themselves after some time.  
*Instructions for Compiling*
1. This is only if you are trying to modify this. If you just want a pre-compiled version go to the releases tab.
2. Use literally any compiler, for this example I am going to be using pyinstaller.
3. `git clone https://github.com/Ixyk-Wolf/SpotifyOverlay/`
4. `cd SpotifyOverlay`
5. `python overlay.py`
6. `pyinstaller --onefile overlay.py`
7. Feel free to modify and recompile!
